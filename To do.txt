Read the maths of Mirror Descent

Look closer at iid sensing vectors and standard Gaussian Measurements  

Implement CDP measurements

Other Algos for Spectral Initialization

-----------------------------------------

Find a better error measure when dealing with complex sensing vectors (Fourier Transform) or images 

Implement complex derivatives of \f and \psi 

Test with zero-boundary real images + real matrix A first. 

Add some positive noise to the measurements: Poisson or Gaussian Noise

---------------------------------------------------------------

Read & compute & implement Wirtinger complex derivative of f and \psi. 
What do they mean? What behavior is to be expected from them? In the case of \psi for instance which is not complex differentiable.

Implement FFT and compare with current DFT

Search Papers on Complex valued derivatives in Phase Retrieval.

Project in signal space to conform to some a-priori knowledge about its structure (signal is real-valued, nonnegative and spatially limited ?)

Solve the scaling error caused by the Wirtinger Flow
